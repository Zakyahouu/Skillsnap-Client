# Document Upload System - Testing Guide

## 🎉 UI Implementation Complete!

The document upload system is now fully integrated into the SchoolManager interface. Here's how to test it:

## ✅ What's Running
- **Backend Server:** http://localhost:5000 (Document API)
- **Frontend Server:** http://localhost:5173 (React UI)

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Access the Admin Dashboard
1. Open browser and navigate to: http://localhost:5173
2. Login as an admin user
3. Navigate to the School Management section

### 2. Find the Documents Button
On each school card, you'll now see:
- **👥 Managers button** (existing)
- **📄 Documents button** (NEW!)

### 3. Test Document Upload
1. Click the **"Documents"** button on any school card
2. A modal will open showing the document management interface
3. You can:
   - **Upload PDF files** (max 10MB, 5 per school)
   - **Name your documents** with custom names
   - **Edit document names** after upload
   - **Download documents** 
   - **Delete documents**

### 4. Test API Features
The UI will test all backend features:
- ✅ **File validation** - Try uploading non-PDF files
- ✅ **Size validation** - Try uploading files >10MB  
- ✅ **Limit enforcement** - Try uploading more than 5 documents
- ✅ **Name editing** - Edit document names
- ✅ **Download functionality** - Download uploaded files
- ✅ **Delete functionality** - Remove documents

## 📱 UI Features

### Upload Section
- **Drag & drop style** upload area
- **File type validation** with clear error messages
- **Auto-suggest document names** from filenames
- **Progress indicators** during upload
- **Document counter** (X/5 documents)

### Document List
- **Clean card layout** for each document
- **File information** (size, upload date, uploader)
- **Inline name editing** with save/cancel buttons
- **Action buttons** (edit, download, delete)
- **Confirmation dialogs** for destructive actions

### Real-time Feedback
- **Success messages** (auto-dismiss after 5 seconds)
- **Error messages** with clear explanations
- **Loading states** during operations
- **Hover effects** and smooth transitions

## 🔐 Security Testing
- Only **admin users** can access document features
- **JWT authentication** required for all API calls
- **File type restrictions** enforced
- **Path sanitization** prevents directory traversal

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If documents don't load:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify admin authentication token
3. Ensure backend server is running on port 5000

### If upload fails:
1. Check file is PDF format
2. Verify file size is under 10MB
3. Ensure school doesn't already have 5 documents
4. Check for duplicate document names

### If download doesn't work:
1. Ensure file exists on server
2. Check backend uploads directory: `server/uploads/school-documents/`
3. Verify admin permissions

## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. Upload a PDF with custom name ✅
2. Edit the document name ✅  
3. Download the document ✅
4. Delete the document ✅

### Error Handling
1. Try uploading non-PDF file ❌
2. Try uploading file >10MB ❌
3. Try uploading 6th document ❌
4. Try duplicate document name ❌

### Edge Cases
1. Very long document names
2. Special characters in names
3. Large PDF files (close to 10MB)
4. Network interruption during upload

## 📊 Success Metrics
- ✅ Upload success rate
- ✅ Download success rate  
- ✅ Error handling coverage
- ✅ UI responsiveness
- ✅ Admin-only access enforcement

## 🚀 Ready for Production!
Once testing is complete, the document upload system is ready for:
- Production deployment
- User training
- Documentation handover
- Feature enhancement
