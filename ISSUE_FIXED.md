# ðŸ”§ Issue Fixed: Admin Dashboard Now Shows Document Upload

## âœ… Problem Identified & Solved

### **Root Cause:**
The AdminDashboard was still importing and using the old `SchoolPanel` component instead of the new `SchoolManager` component that includes the document upload functionality.

### **What Was Fixed:**
1. **Updated Import:** Changed from `SchoolPanel` to `SchoolManager` in AdminDashboard.jsx
2. **Updated Component:** Replaced `<SchoolPanel />` with `<SchoolManager />` in the render
3. **Restarted Dev Server:** Fresh start to pick up all new files

### **Files Changed:**
- âœ… `AdminDashboard.jsx` - Now uses correct SchoolManager component
- âœ… `SchoolManager.jsx` - Contains document upload functionality  
- âœ… `SchoolDocuments.jsx` - Full document management modal
